With over a dozen years at the forefront of leadership, I've journeyed through the intricacies and challenges of guiding teams to their zenith. My passion has always been anchored in nurturing growth through honing emotional intelligence in individuals or optimizing processes with Lean Six Sigma techniques. The transformative power of effective leadership, especially when coupled with emotional intelligence, has been my witness.

Yet, with an insatiable drive for innovation and a penchant for continuous learning, I'm charting a fresh course: transitioning into software development. While seemingly a departure, this move is a beautiful confluence of my leadership skills with the dynamic world of technology. I'm enthused about the potential to merge my rich experience in leadership with the analytical and problem-solving prowess required in software development.
